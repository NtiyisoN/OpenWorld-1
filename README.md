# OpenWorld
OpenWorld is a software library for game designers that can generate and manage expansive, randomized settings for your game. Create an entire universe filled with planets, countries, civilizations, people, languages and objectsâ€¦ or create some (or just one) of any of these as needed and put them to use in your project!

## Build status
The first full "release" is currently slated for early 2020. Contact the author at contact@blake-cooper.com for updates, or with any questions.

## Roadmap
I envision the first iteration of this software to be focused on practical tools for digital game developers. In the future, I'd like to adapt it for other use cases:

1. **"Tabletop mode"**. With an additional CLI/GUI, OpenWorld could easily support analog gamers who want to create and track worlds for tabletop, pencil-and-paper games like Dungeons and Dragons.
2. **Dynamic world modelling**. OpenWorld's features are static by design, so as to be manipulated as needed by game designers in the context of their games. A dynamic modelling mode could track events--births, lives and deaths, creation and destruction, the rise and fall of political powers etc.--with the passage of time. 
3. **Plugins for common game systems**. Stats and mechanics for popular gaming systems could be added via plugin to OpenWorld to aid in implemention with those systems. For example, a D&D plugin could add HP, ability scores and modifiers, speed etc. to creatures (currently, stats like these are not included to allow for customization by game devs).
